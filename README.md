# odin-etch-a-sketch
My implementation of the Etch-a-Sketch project from TheOdinProject. Done as review of HTML/CSS/JS


Final remarks. I enjoyed this project quite a bit.

While styling was not mentioned, the original goals of the project were to create a Etch-a-Sketch lookalike in functionality. Meaning, dragging over a pixel within the grid slightly fills it in. Going over a square will darken it further. As well, users should be able to resize the Etch-a-Sketch to a max of 100x100 cells.

I expanded it slightly. Added choice of colors(the next step would be an actual Hue selector), and I added the functionality of color mixing. Meaning if a user goes over a cell that's already colored, it mixes the colors by adding their RGB values together. I also added the ability to toggle the brush, and added an eraser. As well, added the ability
to toggle the grid on and off. 

These can be done using the buttons or:
'G' - Toggle Grid
'B' - Toggle Brush
'E' - Toggle Eraser



While building this project, I came to a number of things learned.

One:

Yeah, definitely do the basics then refactor to the more in-depth features. The concept of the project excited me, so I went straight into coding and implementing
the full color, brush, and erasing features. Big mistake. Refactored a number of times because of this.

Two:
Learned/reviewed alot about DOM Manipulation, my previous school projects were very backend heavy and served static webpages or forms. Use of 
javascript was limited to that, or functionality within frameworks and packages such as Bootstrap and React.

Three:
Frontend, lots of fun. I imagine even more so when I have a stronger grasp of CSS and its frameworks. My CSS skills are lacking currently.
